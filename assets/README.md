This planner welcomes you to a landing screen with a jumbotron. The jumbotron provides instruction to the user about the web app. Once the the jumbotron button is clicked "Plan!" the page will load the planner.

The planner keeps track of the date and time without needing refreshing.

Each hour of the day is listed in the planner within the input box to fill in planned events

grey boxes are color coded for past events or elapsed time

the green box is color coded for current time of day

the blue boxs are color coded for future times of day

the "+" button to the right of the input box will save the user's information that was entered in the input box. when the page refreshs the jumbotron screen will appear again and the planner will be hidden but any information that was added with the "+" will be retreived and displayed in the appropriate box/time of day.
